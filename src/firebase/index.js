// Itâ€™s a simple entry point file to the Firebase module by grouping and exposing all the functionalities from the module to other modules in one file. 

import * as auth from './auth';
import * as firebase from './firebase';

export {
  auth,
  firebase,
};

//That way, consumers (React components in our case) should be only allowed to access the index.js file as the sole interface to the entire Firebase module (src/firebase/), 
//and should not access the auth or firebase files directly.
